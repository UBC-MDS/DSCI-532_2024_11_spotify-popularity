## App Sketch and Description

The Spotify Popularity Dashboard is comprised of two lab views - 'By Genre' and 'By Artist'. The 'By Genre' tab allows you to select one genre and explore the popularity of artists and songs in the given genre. Similarly, the 'By Artist' tab allows you to select one artist and browse the popularity of this artist across the songs in their different genres. Common across both tabs is the 'Song Features - Top 5 Popular Songs' statistics (on the right) where the average values across the different features of the top 5 popular songs that match the selected criteria are displayed. For each of the four views, there are four different plots (in the middle of the screen) that give insights on how features of the given subset of songs are related to popularity. Finally, above the plots are where you can customize the view which includes a drop down (to select either one genre or one artist), a date range picker to choose the time frame you wish to analyze, and a bar allowing you to select either multiple artists in a given genre (By Genre view), or multiple genres for a given artist (By Artist view).
