In the development of our Spotify Popularity Dashboard, we have successfully implemented several key features proposed in our initial design. Currently, the dashboard offers a 'By Genre' tab that allows users to select a specific genre, a timeframe, and artists corresponding to the chosen genre, providing a targeted analysis of particular music industry segments. Among our visualizations, we implemented the time-series plot *Artist Popularity Over Time*, bar plot *Popularity of Top Songs*, and statisitics *Song Features (Mean) for the Top 5 Popular Songs*.

We didn't involve the 'By Artist' tab as initially planned upon realizing that our dataset, *artists.csv*, lacks temporal data, making it impossible to select a start and end year for analysis. Additionally, the 'By Artist' tab functionally mirrored the 'By Genre' tab, and by eliminating it, we could streamline the dashboard's interface and simplifies user interaction. To compensate the loss of insights from this elimination, we modify the *Mean Popularity of Explicit Songs* to *Mean Popularity of Songs by Type and Artist*, now featuring two color-coded bars (for explicit & clean) representing each selected artist. Furthermore, we changed the focus of our analysis from duration to speechiness with our *Popularity by Speechiness Over Time* plot. We believe that insights drawn from speechiness --- which quantifies the presence of spoken words in a track --- offer more actionable information.

Our dashboard currently performs well in presenting a comprehensive overview of music popularity features, leveraging an engaging visual theme that resonates with Spotify. Its filters and data visualizations allow users to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets.

Regarding limitations, our choice to align the dashboard's color scheme with Spotify's signature green has presented challenges. With more artists added, the subtle variations in green become less distinguishable, potentially disadvantaging users who are not sensitive to colours. Transitioning to a categorical color scheme could address this problem by enhancing contrast (learned in 531) but may compromise the Spotify theme and risk visual clutter.
