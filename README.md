# DSCI-532 Spotify Popularity

## Our Motivation and Purpose
Music is one of the biggest sectors in the entertainment industry and record labels need to evaluate their artists as well as find new artists to invest in. This dashboard application will allow record companies to make data driven decisions. Record companies will be able to filter by artist and genre to see popularity of the artists as well as what makes them popular.


## Who are we?
We are a data scientist consultancy firm and we believe that record companies have the 
data to be more data-driven in the era where data is abundant.
Our team consists of Rachel Bouwer, Koray Tecimer, He Ma, and Yimeng Xia.

## Usage
To generate insights use genre selector, artist selector and also specify the start and end date to filter the data. 
The plots will update based on the given inputs. 
The plots will show the relationship between different insights for the given genre and artist.
The features for top 5 popular songs will be displayed on the right side of the dashboard.
